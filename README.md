# 🪐 Planets Finder

This is a Planets Finder App.
With this App you can find basic information about planets that interest you.

**Users should be able to:**

- connect to the API, fetching information about different planets;

**Connection with the API is possible in three ways:**

- either after having typed the planet name;
- or fetching randomized data after clicking the 'I'm feeling lucky' button;
- or manually clicking one of the planets in our solar system;

After connecting with the API, the users are redirected to the planets info page.

**Main features:**

- fetching data from the API;
- working mobile / desktop versions (responsive design);
- CSS animation of the solar system;
- hover and focus states for the interactive elements on the page;

CSS Animation of the solar system stops on hover, in order to be able to choose a planet. After clicking the chosen planet, a connection to the API is made with the name of the said planet. As the animation is concentrated in a circular orbit.
The app is tested in Vitest / React Testing Library.
